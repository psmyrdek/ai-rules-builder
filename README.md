## How to Write Effective Rules

When contributing new rules, please:

- **Be specific:** "Use React.memo for expensive components" not "Optimize components"
- **Make it actionable:** Provide clear guidance that can be immediately applied
- **Include placeholders:** Use `{{placeholder_text}}` for project-specific values
- **Follow conventions:** Match the style and structure of existing rules
- **Focus on best practices:** Rules should represent industry standards, not personal preferences

See examples in `src/data/rules/` directory for each technology stack.
